# Overview

In these games, we are using functions such as array, while loop, for loops, and conditions like if and else if.
The purpose of this program is that when we have a whole bunch of things to do and it's hard for us to decide which one to choose from, we can let the computer choose those options for us. As in our program, the computer will select an adventure for us to enjoy.
